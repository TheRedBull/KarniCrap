Karni's Crap Filter
===================

Addon for World of Warcraft.
Original author: Karnifex

Karnifex finally got tired of looting 8 copper Fish Scales and accepted the quest to figure out how to never do it again. Thus, Karni's Crap Filter was born. It automatically loots what you want and skips what you don't want, saving bag space for good stuff like hookers and weapons. It's also a robust, full-featured and hopefully easy to use auto loot system!


Forked from jeffrysleddens/KarniCrap, updated from fubaWoW/KarniCrap, and updated for better SL compatibility
